introductory comments
* Why am i making this series?  to show how I am teaching myself C++ over the last 18 months.
* C++ is a grate hobby langauge for older learners.
* you can spend as much time as you like on each concept. 1hrs a day or all day if you like.
* I noticed a lack of beginner friendly C++ tutorials aimed at older learners.
* There are plenty of C++ tutorials out there, but most are aimed at younger audiences.
* Plus learning a programming langauge at an older age keeps the mind active and engaged.
* and lastly, learning C++ if you have A pc is all but free.
All tutorials will be aimed at older learners.
So Many tutorials race through concepts, use small text, or skip steps;
A Slow & Clear C++ series aimed at older learners & pensioners (or anyone who prefers a slower pace)
